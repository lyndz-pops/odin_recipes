        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This homemade hamburger helper is far better than the boxed mix. With fresh spices, and a hint of tomato, it's beefy, cheesy, savory, and has all the makings of a weeknight family favorite.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
            <li><sup>1/2</sup> cup diced yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li><sup>1/2</sup> teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li><sup>1/2</sup> teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li><sup>1/2</sup> teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li><sup>1/4</sup> teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li><sup>1/4</sup> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 <sup>1/2</sup> cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 cup elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>6 oz cheddar cheese, shredded (about 1 <sup>1/2</sup> cups)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is crumbled, browned, and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Spoon off and discard any fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste, ketchup, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, paprika, and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add beef broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in macaroni; reduce heat to medium, and gently boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, and stir in Cheddar, ensuring cheese is fully melted and incorporated, 30 to 45 seconds. Let stand until thickened before serving, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
