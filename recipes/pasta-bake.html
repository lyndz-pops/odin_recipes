        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>12 oz uncooked penne pasta</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 <sup>1/2</sup> teaspoons italian seasoning, divided</li>
            <li>2 <sup>1/2</sup> teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup drained jarred julienne-cut sun-dried tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons oil from sun-dried tomato jar divided</li>
            <li>1 <sup>1/2</sup> cups finely chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>6 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li><sup>1/3</sup> cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>5 oz fresh baby spinach</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li><sup>1/2</sup> cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li><sup>1/2</sup> cup panko</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high. Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Drain pasta and transfer to an ungreased 13- x 9-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Season chicken breasts evenly with black pepper and 1 teaspoon each of the Italian seasoning and salt. Heat 2 tablespoons of sun-dried tomato oil in a large skillet over medium until shimmering. Add chicken breasts and cook until golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes, flipping occasionally. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Thinly slice chicken and add to pasta in baking dish. Do not clean skillet.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of the sun-dried tomato oil to skillet and return to medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add white wine, tomato paste, and 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, and cook, stirring often, until liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in butter until melted. Sprinkle flour over sun-dried tomato mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and pasty, about 1 minute. Gradually stir in reserved pasta cooking water and milk.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring often, until thickened and smooth, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add spinach, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cook over medium, stirring constantly, until wilted and bright green, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of the Paremsan cheese until melted. Transfer to pasta mixture in baking dish and stir until well combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil in a small skillet over medium-high. Add panko and remaining 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Sprinkle pasta mixture with remaining 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and toasted panko mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Garnish with basil.</li>
